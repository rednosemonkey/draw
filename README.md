# Draw #

Draw is primarily a mobile drawing app, but has support for both touch and mouse. The simple interface is to make it easy to use for small kids.

Checkout the [live demo site](http://rednosemonkey.com/draw)

I have written a [multiplayer version](https://github.com/rednosemonkey/Multi-person-drawing-app) of this app. It uses websockets and runs on a node server. It is not yet complete, but can still be tried out at [drawwithfriend.com](http://www.drawwithfriend.com/). Open 2 (or more) browser windows and give it a try!
